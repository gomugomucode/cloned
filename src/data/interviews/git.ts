    question: 'What is the staging area in Git?',
    answer: 'The staging area (index) is a middle directory layer where files are gathered and reviewed before committing. Running git add moves files to staging, and git commit packages the staging contents into the history timeline.',
    level: 'Beginner',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you undo the last commit without losing code changes?',
    answer: 'Run git reset --soft HEAD~1. This command deletes the latest commit, but retains all file changes staged, ready for editing and committing again.',
    level: 'Intermediate',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Git reflog and how can it save your code?',
    answer: 'git reflog is a local ledger log documenting every action that updates HEAD (commits, checks, resets, rebases). If you force delete a branch or perform an incorrect hard reset, reflog lets you find the SHA of lost commits and restore them using git checkout or git merge.',
