    question: 'What is JSX and is it compile-time or run-time?',
    answer: 'JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript used to describe component structures. It is parsed at compile-time (e.g. by Babel/Vite) into React.createElement() function calls, resulting in plain JavaScript objects at runtime.',
    level: 'Beginner',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?',
    answer: 'useMemo returns a memoized value resulting from a computation function, skipping recalculations unless dependency arrays change. useCallback returns a memoized callback function instance itself, preventing child component re-renders that rely on reference equality.',
    level: 'Intermediate',
  },
  {
    question: 'Explain how React Server Components (RSC) differ from Client Components.',
    answer: 'React Server Components execute exclusively on the server, allowing direct access to database resources, filesystems, and microservices without APIs. Their code bundle is never sent to the browser, significantly reducing JS payloads. Client Components are traditional components downloaded to the browser, supporting interactive event bindings (onClick), state (useState), and hooks (useEffect).',
