    question: 'What is a Docker image vs a Docker container?',
    answer: 'An image is a read-only, immutable template blueprint that packages the system configuration, runtime dependencies, and application code. A container is a runnable, isolated instance of that image, running as an isolated OS process.',
    level: 'Beginner',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the purpose of Docker Compose?',
    answer: 'Docker Compose is a tool for defining and coordinating multi-container applications. It configures shared container networks, storage volumes, env parameters, and boot sequences in a single YAML file, started with `docker-compose up`.',
    level: 'Intermediate',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you optimize Docker image sizes for production?',
    answer: 'Use Multi-Stage Builds to compile binaries or package assets in build container stages, and copy only final outputs into lightweight runtime images (e.g. Alpine). Minimize Dockerfile layers by combining RUN commands, and specify target files in .dockerignore.',
    level: 'Advanced',
  },
